    <div class="sticky-top"> What are some good books about skateboarding?
   </h5>
  </div>

  <p class="text-justify">There are an immense number of books accessible regarding the matter of skateboarding, be that as it may, a large
  portion of them are personal, anecdotal, how-to, or mission based. Quest Amazon for Skateboard books and you'll discover
  bounty. Notwithstanding, there is one sort of book which has been extremely neglected: fiction.
  This has been endeavored by various gifted customarily distributed creators however has neglected to contact crowds for
  a couple of key reasons. In particular, the references to skateboarding in fiction is either a little character
  characteristic or interest of the hero; the skateboarding referred to is fundamental, dull, and unimaginative, or; (and
  this is difficult to demonstrate, yet I presume it) the skateboarding is worked out of the story totally on counsel from
  Editors and Operators.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">In Scratch Hornby's, Pummel the hero is a monstrous Tony Falcon fan and converses with a banner on their divider. The
  hero skates, yet this component of the story goes no-where and seldom gets referred to past the initial barely any
  sections. The skateboarding is essentially a character characteristic/leisure activity.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">In Blake Nelson's, Jumpy Park, the hero is a skateboarder and hangs out at the neighborhood park with companions
  skating. This world is practical, particular, and consequently convincing. Be that as it may, the skating in the book is
  oversimplified and dull, which will kill committed skateboarders. The book is as yet a decent read and has been made
  into a film of similar name by Gus Van Holy person, however don't expect a single thing from the skating aside from a
  couple of climatic cutaway shots</p>

  <p class="text-justify">In Michael Christie's, In the event that I fall, On the off chance that I kick the bucket, the hero likewise skates.
  Micheal was a previous expert skateboarder, so I've no uncertainty (and suspect) the skateboarding highlighted in the
  story was explicit, contemporary, and 'right', however as almost no of this showed up in the distributed rendition, I
  can just expect that either Michael worked it out himself, or on the guidance of editors/specialists, or did exclude any
  sensible skateboarding because of feeling that it would put off a bigger number of perusers than it would energize. I'm
  speculating that this was an intentional Showcasing move by the distributer.
